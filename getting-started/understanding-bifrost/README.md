# Understanding Bifrost

## What is Bifrost?

The easiest way to understand Bifrost is to see it as a derivative issuer that provides liquidity for all pledged assets, issuing corresponding shadow assets during the bonding period of the original assets. At the same time, the shadow asset is a fungible Token can be circulated in different DEXs, pools, protocols and cross-chains.&#x20;

## What is Bifrost Solving?

As a DeFi protocol, Bifrost is aiming to solve the following issues in PoS ecosystems:

* The paradox between **Staking** rewards and **DeFi** yields
* The balance between Token **Staking**/Circulating and **security** of PoS chains
* **Staking** rewards in **cross-chain** scenarios

According to the questions above, Bifrost's solution **vToken** (Staking Derivatives Voucher Token) eligible for users to convert PoS token to vToken and obtain stakinng liquidity and Staking rewards  synchronously, without barriers in cross-chain senarios.

## Why Bifrost?

### Liquid-Staking

Mint vToken on BIfrost i.e. stake via Bifrost, you can control your underlying staking assets during the period.

### Automatic Staking Management&#x20;

Bifrost Staking protocols are all running under the BIfrost parachain pallets, earn staking rewards every 24 hours, without centralized risks.

### Extra Staking Returns + DeFi Yields

Bifrost does delegating staking for users by selecting a set of validators and rebalancing the rewards, gives out more profitable solutions. By holding the vToken, you will have chances to head into more yield senarios.
