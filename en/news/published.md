**活动规则**

I am fortunate to be able to progress with such excellent teams as Acala and Stafi. Compared to Acala and Stafi, Bifrost aims to provide staking liquidity while focusing more on lowering user staking thresholds and increasing staking revenue.

**3. If I am now a candidate node for Kusama, can I increase our voting rights by bidding in the Bifrost stacking pool?**

Well, yes. Like an exchange bill, you can use KSM to buy tickets from the pool to increase your voting rights. It's like leverage, using the KSM annualized cost to get more votes.

For example, if you pay 40% annualisation, the price to buy 10000 KSM and vote for 10 days is 109.58 KSM (10000 * 0.4 / 365 * 10).

**4. What stage is Bifrost in? How to access Boca ecology and contribute to it in the future?**

**6. How did you notice polkadot and substrate?**

The first contact with Polkadot should be from Substrate. At that time, the business based on smart contract development was limited. When looking for a solution, I learned that Substrate may be a viable technical framework. After comparing Cosmos-SDK and Substrate, we finally chose Substrate.

**7. What's the greatest help to you and your team with substrate?**

In terms of technology, lowering the barriers to blockchain development will save a lot of development workload. In terms of products, Substrate is natively compatible with the Polkadot relay network, which enables rapid deployment of multi-chain scenarios. Of course, there are also Web3 foundation grant and Substrate builder plans that will provide funding, market, product, financing, planning, etc. help

**8. Can you share how you got grant from Web3 foundation?**

我认为没有什么特别的技巧，只要是符合 Web3 愿景，可以产生实际价值，踏实做事的团队，都有机会拿到 Web3 基金会的 Grant。推荐有想法、有技术的团队都可以试着申请一下。

**9. What are your biggest expectations for polkadot and Bifrost in 2020?**
