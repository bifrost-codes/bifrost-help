In formal occasions (such as official posters, cooperative publicity, official announcements, etc.), please be sure to use the complete "graphic + text" logo
<img :src="$withBase('/zh/brand-assets/brand-assets-05.png')" alt="" />

In some other scenarios (such as project avatars, promotional images, social media images, etc.), you can use either the full logo or the "individual graphic logo" according to actual needs.When the display area is a square/circular area similar to 1: 1, and the display size is relatively small, if there is a clear text that reflects Bifrost, it is recommended to use "Single Graphic Logo" in the Logo part
