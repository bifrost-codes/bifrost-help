# Technical Committee

The Technical Committee is composed of the teams that have successfully implemented or specified either a Bifrost runtime or Bifrost Host. Teams are added or removed from the Technical Committee via a simple majority vote of the **Council**.

The Technical Committee can, along with the Council, produce emergency referenda, which are **fast-tracked** for voting and implementation. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.

**Fast-tracked** referenda are the only type of referenda that can be active alongside another active referendum. Thus, with fast-tracked referenda it is possible to have two active referendums at the same time. Voting on one does not prevent a user from voting on the other.&#x20;
