# üèõ Governance (Kusama)

## Governance Structure

Bifrost won kusama's fifth parachain slot on July 20, 2021. Bifrost, which has become a parachain, will regard democratic governance as the primary action plan, use the same governance module framework as Kusama, and partially adjust governance parameters according to its own business needs, and derive a governance module that is more adapted to the pace of DeFi innovation. Bifrost will continue the consistent governance mechanism of Polkadot and Kusama as a whole: a tricameral governance structure, which is a relatively mature on-chain governance mechanism, that is, coordinated governance by tripartite institutions-the public, the parliament, and the technical committee.
