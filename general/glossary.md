## NPoS

Nominated PoS。权益证明系统，提名人以自己的股份支持验证人，以表明对验证人良好行为的信心。提名权益证明与更一般的概念“委托权益证明”不同，提名人提名不良验证人将失去股份。委托人不会因验证人的行为而失去本金。请注意，即使可以大幅度减少委托人，其他一些区块链技术也可以使用术语委托权益证明。 Polkadot使用Phragmén方法将Staking分配给被提名人。

## DPoS

The Delegated Proof of Stake \(DPoS\) consensus algorithm was developed by Daniel Larimer, in 2014. Bitshares, Steem, Ark, and Lisk are some of the cryptocurrency projects that make use of DPoS consensus algorithm. A DPoS-based blockchain counts with a voting system where stakeholders outsource their work to a third-party. In other words, they are able to vote for a few delegates that will secure the network on their behalf. The delegates may also be referred to as witnesses and they are responsible for achieving consensus during the generation and validation of new blocks. The voting power is proportional to the number of coins each user holds. The voting system varies from project to project, but in general, each delegate presents an individual proposal when asking for votes. Usually, the rewards collected by the delegates are proportionally shared with their respective electors.

Therefore, the DPoS algorithm creates a voting system that is directly dependent on the delegates’ reputation. If an elected node misbehaves or does not work efficiently, it will be quickly expelled and replaced by another one.

## PLO

Parachain Lease Offering. Polkadot is a blockchain network that scales by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchain shards called parachains. Parachains are specialized shards of Polkadot that give projects and their communities agency over their respective goals. Parachain slots are limited, and will be auctioned off in unpermissioned candle auctions. Rather than auction many parachain slots together, it's more likely \(though not yet confirmed\) that they will be auctioned off one-by-one, so that there’s only a single parachain auction occuring at any given time.

## DeFi

Decentralized Finance. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of applications and projects in the public blockchain space geared toward disrupting the traditional finance world. Inspired by blockchain technology, DeFi is referred to as financial applications built on blockchain technologies, typically using smart contracts. Smart contracts are automated enforceable agreements that do not need intermediaries to execute and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. DeFi consists of applications and peer-to-peer protocols developed on decentralized blockchain networks that require no access rights for easy lending, borrowing, or trading of financial tools. Most DeFi applications today are built using the Ethereum network, but many alternative public networks are emerging that deliver superior speed, scalability, security, and lower costs.

## Dex

Decentralized Exchanges. DEX are a type of cryptocurrency exchange which allows for direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without the need for an intermediary.

## DApp

Decentralized Applications. A decentralized application \(DApp, Dapp\) is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system.DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies \(DLT\) such as the Ethereum Blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts.
