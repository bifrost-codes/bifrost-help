## NPoS

Nominated PoS。权益证明系统，提名人以自己的股份支持验证人，以表明对验证人良好行为的信心。提名权益证明与更一般的概念“委托权益证明”不同，提名人提名不良验证人将失去股份。委托人不会因验证人的行为而失去本金。请注意，即使可以大幅度减少委托人，其他一些区块链技术也可以使用术语委托权益证明。 Polkadot使用Phragmén方法将Staking分配给被提名人。

## DPoS

委托权益证明（DPoS）共识算法由Daniel Larimer在2014年开发。Bitshares，Steem，Ark和Lisk是使用DPoS共识算法的一些加密货币项目。基于DPoS的区块链采用投票系统，在该系统中，利益相关者将其工作外包给第三方。换句话说，他们能够投票给代表自己保护网络的一些代表。代表也可以称为见证人，他们负责在生成和验证新区块期间达成共识。投票权与每个用户持有的硬币数量成正比。投票系统因项目而异，但总的来说，每个代表在投票时都会提出一个单独的提案。通常，代表们收集的奖励与他们各自的选民按比例分享。因此，DPoS算法创建的投票系统直接取决于代表的声誉。如果选举出的节点行为不正常或无法有效工作，则该节点将被迅速驱逐并替换为另一个节点。

## PLO

Parachain Lease Offering. Polkadot is a blockchain network that scales by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchain shards called parachains. Parachains are specialized shards of Polkadot that give projects and their communities agency over their respective goals. Parachain slots are limited, and will be auctioned off in unpermissioned candle auctions. Rather than auction many parachain slots together, it's more likely \(though not yet confirmed\) that they will be auctioned off one-by-one, so that there’s only a single parachain auction occuring at any given time.

## DeFi

Decentralized Finance. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of applications and projects in the public blockchain space geared toward disrupting the traditional finance world. Inspired by blockchain technology, DeFi is referred to as financial applications built on blockchain technologies, typically using smart contracts. Smart contracts are automated enforceable agreements that do not need intermediaries to execute and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. DeFi consists of applications and peer-to-peer protocols developed on decentralized blockchain networks that require no access rights for easy lending, borrowing, or trading of financial tools. Most DeFi applications today are built using the Ethereum network, but many alternative public networks are emerging that deliver superior speed, scalability, security, and lower costs.

## Dex

Decentralized Exchanges. DEX are a type of cryptocurrency exchange which allows for direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without the need for an intermediary.

## DApp

Decentralized Applications. A decentralized application \(DApp, Dapp\) is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system.DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies \(DLT\) such as the Ethereum Blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts.
