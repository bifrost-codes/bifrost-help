# Launch

The Genesis block of the Bifrost network will launch soon, as a Proof of Authority \(PoA\) network, with governance controlled by the single Sudo \(super-user\) account. During this time, validators can start joining the network and signaling their intention to participate in consensus. The network will evolve to become a Proof of Stake \(PoS\) network. With the chain secured by the decentralized community of validators, the Sudo module will be removed, transitioning the governance of the chain into the hands of the token \(BNC\) holders. This is the point where Bifrost will become decentralized.
