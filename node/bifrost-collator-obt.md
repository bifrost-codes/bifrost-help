# Bifrost Collator OBT

\*Please note that "BNC" included in this article is BNC test Token for pre-production environments.

### Hareware Requirements

**System: Ubuntu 22.04**

* **CPU** - 4 core (3.2GHZ above)
* **Memory** - 16GB
* **Storage** - 200GB SSD
* **Bandwidth** - 10 Mbps above

**Tip**: CPU frequency lower than 3.2GHZ may affect the normal block generation of collator. Storage recommends using an SSD that supports the NVMe protocol.

### Operating System

`Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`

### Operating Procedures

* **Delegator**
  1. Create a [BNC Address](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/start/create)
  2. Receive faucet test BNC: [https://t.me/bifrost\_faucet](https://t.me/bifrost\_faucet)
  3. Enter Bifrost Dapp (switch to **Bifrost Stage Network**) and delegate a Collator
* **Collator**:
  1. Create a [BNC Address](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/start/create)
  2. Receive faucet test BNC: [https://t.me/bifrost\_faucet](https://t.me/bifrost\_faucet)
  3. Run Collator Node & Map SessionKey in the Bifrost pre-production environment (wss://bifrost-rpc.testnet.liebi.com/ws): [Guidance](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/node/run-a-collator-node)
  4. Check your Collator at [Bifrost Dapp](https://bifrost.app/collator) (switch to **Bifrost Stage Network**)/ [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/0x9f28c6a68e0fc9646eff64935684f6eeeece527e37bbe1f213d22caa1d9d6bed)
  5. Get Delegating
  6. Successfully generate blocks and enter the active Collator set to get Commission rewards

### Operation Cycle

The Collator system has its own running cycle, **150 blocks in a round**, each round takes about 0.5 hours, and the cycle is related to the operations of reward settlement, addition, and unbonding.

### Basic Parameters

#### Glossary

* **Collator:** Collator runs a full node on Bifrost parachain and Kusama relay-chain, and produce the state transition proof for relay chain validators.
* **Active set:** A set of Collators who can receive commission by producing blocks, choosen by the ranking of delegating amount.
* **Candidates:** Collators who out of Active set.
* **Collator Self-bond:** Self-bond as least 50 BNC to be a Collator, continue self-bond same as delegating.
* **Delegator:** Bifrost token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates on the parachain.
* **Delegate:** Bond BNC Token for Bifrost Collators, receiving delegating rewards depends on the rank of Collator and delegating amount.
