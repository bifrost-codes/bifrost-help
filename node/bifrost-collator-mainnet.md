# Bifrost Collator Mainnet

### Hareware Requirements

**System: Ubuntu 22.04**

* **CPU** - 4 core (3.2GHZ above)
* **Memory** - 16GB
* **Storage** - 200GB SSD
* **Bandwidth** - 10 Mbps above

**Tip**: CPU frequency lower than 3.2GHZ may affect the normal block generation of collator. Storage recommends using an SSD that supports the NVMe protocol.

### Operating System

`Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`

### Operating Procedures

* **Delegator**
  1. Create a [BNC Address](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/start/create)
  2. Enter Bifrost Dapp (**Mainnet**) and delegate a Collator
* **Collator**:
  1. Create a [BNC Address](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/start/create)
  2. Run Collator Node & Map SessionKey in the Bifrost mainnet ([https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Feu.bifrost-rpc.liebi.com%2Fws#](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Feu.bifrost-rpc.liebi.com%2Fws#)): [Guidance](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/node/run-a-collator-node)
  3. Check your Collator at [Bifrost Dapp](https://bifrost.app/collator) (switch to **Mainnet**)/ [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/0x9f28c6a68e0fc9646eff64935684f6eeeece527e37bbe1f213d22caa1d9d6bed)
  4. Get Delegating
  5. Successfully generate blocks and enter the active Collator set to get Commission rewards

### Operation Cycle

The Collator system has its own running cycle, **600 blocks in a round**, each round takes about 2 hours, and the cycle is related to the operations of reward settlement, addition, and unbonding.

#### Collator incentive ratio

| Total 800,000 BNC/Year | Proportion |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Collator Commission    | 10%        |
| Delegator              | 90%        |

#### Reward Calculation

Bifrost network reserved 5% (4,000,000 BNC) of total issurance to incentivize Collator mechanism for 5 years (800,000 BNC/year), with no inflation. The reward for each Round is a fixed 180 BNC. The reward calculation method is as follows.

According to the incentive ratio, the reward for each block is:

`Collator:`` `<mark style="color:blue;">`180/600*10% = 0.03 BNC`</mark>

`Delegator:`` `<mark style="color:blue;">`180/600*90% = 0.27 BNC`</mark>

If a collector's total delegating amount is 100,000 BNC and it is in the 64 Active Collator set for the whole year, the average revenue of the Collator is:

`Collating Reward:`` `<mark style="color:blue;">`800,000 x 10% / 64 = 1,250 BNC`</mark>

`Self-bond delegating Reward:`` `<mark style="color:blue;">`800,000 x 90% / 64 x 5,000/100,000 = 562.5 BNC`</mark>

`Total Revenue:`` `<mark style="color:blue;">`1,250 + 562.5 = 1,812.5 BNC`</mark>

`APR:`` `<mark style="color:blue;">`1,812.5/5,000 = 36.25%`</mark>
