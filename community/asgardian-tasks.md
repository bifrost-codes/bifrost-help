# Asgardian Tasks

All _<mark style="color:purple;">Asgardians</mark>_ are expected to complete essential ambassador activities to keep their position on the Team. In addition to these activities, Asgardians can also execute tasks and receive extra rewards.

Essential activities:&#x20;

* Supporting community members across various communication channels (i.e. Discord, Telegram, Twitter),&#x20;
* Participating in Bifrost Team meetings and Community Calls,&#x20;
* Raising awareness of Bifrost within and outside of the DotSama ecosystem.

_<mark style="color:purple;">Asgardians</mark>_ that complete essential activities are eligible to engage in tasks and receive rewards. Tasks can include creating content, running competitions, organizing events, etc.

When a task is completed, the Asgardian should submit the task for review. The Asgardian can also submit tasks for discussion and evaluation during Team meetings. Select a task you would like to complete and nominate yourself.

Every second week of the month, according to the contribution given to the protocol and the task completed, each ambassadorâ€™s work will be reviewed and signed off by the Bifrost Core Team. The rewards allocated for the task, can be of two kinds:

* **$BNC**, for the Asgardians who contribute to Bifrost through Wag Media \[insert link here] and other similar platforms, sharing their contents will receive a share of BNC Tokens. The rewards are assigned on a weekly basis and paid by the Wag Media Team itself.&#x20;
* **$USDT**, sent directly to the ERC-20 wallet of the Asgardians who contribute to the Growth of Bifrost protocol executing a specific task, agreed with the Team. This could be an Article, a Design work, a generic support during offline and online events, etc. These tasks are assigned by the Core Team and discussed in advance.
