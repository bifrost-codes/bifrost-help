# Transfer Guide

A step-by-step guide to transferring tokens to and from Bifrost.

## Overview

This guide assumes the user is familiar with sending tokens to the Kusama / Polkadot 'Relay Chain', as a friendly reminder, this process is broken down below:

> * Token begins on an exchange
> * The token is **sent-to/received-from** Kusama/Polkadot
> * From Kusama/Polkadot, the token is **sent-to/received-from** Bifrost

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>) WARNING! Do NOT attempt direct transactions between Bifrost and other exchanges. This is not currently supported and WILL result in lost tokens.
