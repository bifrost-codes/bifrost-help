# vsKSM Buyback

### About Buyback

Bifrost will use the KSM in the buyback fund pool to continue to buyback vsKSM when the price of vsKSM is lower than 0.5. Buybacks are triggered by the Bifrost Council and executed entirely by on-chain logic. The goal of the buyback is to create a stable and healthy vsKSM derivatives trading environment and promote vsKSMâ€™s liquidity and application scenarios. Users of Bifrost are welcome to supervise and suggest on-chain buyback behavior at any time.

### Terms and Conditions for vsToken(BNC) Governance Redemptions

#### vsBond Expiry

In the SALP protocol, vsKSM and expiring vsBond can be redeemed in a 1:1 combination of 1 KSM. As vsBond is tradable and redeemable, there is a risk of malicious hoarding, so in the SALP protocol there is a rule that vsBond cannot be redeemed after 2 leases of expiry, and the corresponding assets will be used to buy back the vsToken. This is to prevent the malicious hoarding of vsBonds and to clean up the chain of low value information to make the network more efficient and to improve the utilisation of funds on the chain for the benefit of active users of the Bifrost SALP protocol.
