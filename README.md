# ðŸŒˆ Getting Started

**Bifrost** is a web3 derivatives protocol that provides decentralized cross-chain liquidity for staked assets. By leveraging on the cross-consensus message (XCM) it can provide **cross-chain liquid staking services for multiple chains**.&#x20;

Bifrostâ€™s mission is to provide standardized cross-chain interest-bearing derivatives for Polkadot relay chains, parachains, and heterogeneous chains bridged with Polkadot. Furthermore, by aggregating over 80% of PoS consensus chainsâ€™ staking liquidity through cross-chain derivatives, our protocol lowers usersâ€™ staking threshold, increases multi-chain staking ratio, and improves the ecosystems application interest base, by creating a three-way positive cycle for the StakeFi ecosystem by empowering users, multi-chains, and ecosystem applications.&#x20;
